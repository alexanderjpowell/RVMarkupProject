Instructions for executing HtmlScore Markup project for Red Ventures application

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My submission for the markup project is written in Python.  My implementation is contained in a single python file: src/HTMLScorer.py

This project was written using Python version 2.7 on OS X 10.12 (Sierra).  

In order to properly run this project, you must have MySQL installed on your machine and the MySQLdb library for Python.  
Additionally, the project uses Python's HTMLParser class for help getting tag info.  

Before running the program, a database named "RedVentures" should be created.  For the sake of this project the program is set to 
login to the mysql with username "root" and password "password".  Obviously for any sort of real application a more secure authentication
method should be established.  

To begin, run the script to create the HtmlScores table in the RedVentures database.  This can be done with the following command.  
> mysql -uroot -ppassword < schema/setup.sql

From there you are ready to execute the program, which can be invoked as simply as:
> python src/HTMLScorer.py

The python file contains 2 classes and the main method at the bottom contains easy to follow examples for how the different methods
can be invoked.  

Note that if the program is run more than once, the HtmlScores table will continue to grow.  If needed to re-run the program, the following 
sql query should be executed to clear out the table.  
mysql> DELETE FROM HtmlScores;
